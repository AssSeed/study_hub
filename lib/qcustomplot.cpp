/*! \class QCPScatterStyle
  \brief Represents the visual appearance of scatter points
  
  This class holds information about shape, color and size of scatter points. In plottables like
  QCPGraph it is used to store how scatter points shall be drawn. For example, \ref
  QCPGraph::setScatterStyle takes a QCPScatterStyle instance.
  
  A scatter style consists of a shape (\ref setShape), a line color (\ref setPen) and possibly a
  fill (\ref setBrush), if the shape provides a fillable area. Further, the size of the shape can
  be controlled with \ref setSize.

  \section QCPScatterStyle-defining Specifying a scatter style
  
  You can set all these configurations either by calling the respective functions on an instance:
  \code
  QCPScatterStyle myScatter;
  myScatter.setShape(QCPScatterStyle::ssCircle);
  myScatter.setPen(Qt::blue);
  myScatter.setBrush(Qt::white);
  myScatter.setSize(5);
  customPlot->graph(0)->setScatterStyle(myScatter);
  \endcode
  
  Or you can use one of the various constructors that take different parameter combinations, making
  it easy to specify a scatter style in a single call, like so:
  \code
  customPlot->graph(0)->setScatterStyle(QCPScatterStyle(QCPScatterStyle::ssCircle, Qt::blue, Qt::white, 5));
  \endcode
  
  \section QCPScatterStyle-undefinedpen Leaving the color/pen up to the plottable
  
  There are two constructors which leave the pen undefined: \ref QCPScatterStyle() and \ref
  QCPScatterStyle(ScatterShape shape, double size). If those constructors are used, a call to \ref
  isPenDefined will return false. It leads to scatter points that inherit the pen from the
  plottable that uses the scatter style. Thus, if such a scatter style is passed to QCPGraph, the line
  color of the graph (\ref QCPGraph::setPen) will be used by the scatter points. This makes
  it very convenient to set up typical scatter settings:
  
  \code
  customPlot->graph(0)->setScatterStyle(QCPScatterStyle::ssPlus);
  \endcode

  Notice that it wasn't even necessary to explicitly call a QCPScatterStyle constructor. This works
  because QCPScatterStyle provides a constructor that can transform a \ref ScatterShape directly
  into a QCPScatterStyle instance (that's the \ref QCPScatterStyle(ScatterShape shape, double size)
  constructor with a default for \a size). In those cases, C++ allows directly supplying a \ref
  ScatterShape, where actually a QCPScatterStyle is expected.
  
  \section QCPScatterStyle-custompath-and-pixmap Custom shapes and pixmaps
  
  QCPScatterStyle supports drawing custom shapes and arbitrary pixmaps as scatter points.

  For custom shapes, you can provide a QPainterPath with the desired shape to the \ref
  setCustomPath function or call the constructor that takes a painter path. The scatter shape will
  automatically be set to \ref ssCustom.
  
  For pixmaps, you call \ref setPixmap with the desired QPixmap. Alternatively you can use the
  constructor that takes a QPixmap. The scatter shape will automatically be set to \ref ssPixmap.
  Note that \ref setSize does not influence the appearance of the pixmap.
*/

/* start documentation of inline functions */

/*! \fn bool QCPScatterStyle::isNone() const
  
  Returns whether the scatter shape is \ref ssNone.
  
  \see setShape
*/

/*! \fn bool QCPScatterStyle::isPenDefined() const
  
  Returns whether a pen has been defined for this scatter style.
  
  The pen is undefined if a constructor is called that does not carry \a pen as parameter. Those are
  \ref QCPScatterStyle() and \ref QCPScatterStyle(ScatterShape shape, double size). If the pen is
  left undefined, the scatter color will be inherited from the plottable that uses this scatter
  style.

  <tt>Qt::NoPen</tt> for a QColor and use the
  \ref QCPScatterStyle(ScatterShape shape, const QColor &color, const QColor &fill, double size)
  constructor instead (which will lead to an unexpected look of the scatter points). To prevent
  this, be more explicit with the parameter types. For example, use <tt>QBrush(Qt::blue)</tt>
  instead of just <tt>Qt::blue</tt>, to clearly point out to the compiler that this constructor is
  wanted.
