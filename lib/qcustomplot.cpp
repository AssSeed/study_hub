/*! \class QCPScatterStyle
  \brief Represents the visual appearance of scatter points
  
  This class holds information about shape, color and size of scatter points. In plottables like
  QCPGraph it is used to store how scatter points shall be drawn. For example, \ref
  QCPGraph::setScatterStyle takes a QCPScatterStyle instance.
  
  A scatter style consists of a shape (\ref setShape), a line color (\ref setPen) and possibly a
  fill (\ref setBrush), if the shape provides a fillable area. Further, the size of the shape can
  be controlled with \ref setSize.

  \section QCPScatterStyle-defining Specifying a scatter style
  
  You can set all these configurations either by calling the respective functions on an instance:
  \code
  QCPScatterStyle myScatter;
  myScatter.setShape(QCPScatterStyle::ssCircle);
  myScatter.setPen(Qt::blue);
  myScatter.setBrush(Qt::white);
  myScatter.setSize(5);
  customPlot->graph(0)->setScatterStyle(myScatter);
  \endcode
  
  Or you can use one of the various constructors that take different parameter combinations, making
  it easy to specify a scatter style in a single call, like so:
  \code
  customPlot->graph(0)->setScatterStyle(QCPScatterStyle(QCPScatterStyle::ssCircle, Qt::blue, Qt::white, 5));
  \endcode
  
  \section QCPScatterStyle-undefinedpen Leaving the color/pen up to the plottable
  
  There are two constructors which leave the pen undefined: \ref QCPScatterStyle() and \ref
  QCPScatterStyle(ScatterShape shape, double size). If those constructors are used, a call to \ref
  isPenDefined will return false. It leads to scatter points that inherit the pen from the
  plottable that uses the scatter style. Thus, if such a scatter style is passed to QCPGraph, the line
  color of the graph (\ref QCPGraph::setPen) will be used by the scatter points. This makes
  it very convenient to set up typical scatter settings:
  
  \code
  customPlot->graph(0)->setScatterStyle(QCPScatterStyle::ssPlus);
  \endcode

  Notice that it wasn't even necessary to explicitly call a QCPScatterStyle constructor. This works
  because QCPScatterStyle provides a constructor that can transform a \ref ScatterShape directly
  into a QCPScatterStyle instance (that's the \ref QCPScatterStyle(ScatterShape shape, double size)
  constructor with a default for \a size). In those cases, C++ allows directly supplying a \ref
  ScatterShape, where actually a QCPScatterStyle is expected.
  
  \section QCPScatterStyle-custompath-and-pixmap Custom shapes and pixmaps
  
  QCPScatterStyle supports drawing custom shapes and arbitrary pixmaps as scatter points.

  For custom shapes, you can provide a QPainterPath with the desired shape to the \ref
  setCustomPath function or call the constructor that takes a painter path. The scatter shape will
  automatically be set to \ref ssCustom.
  
  For pixmaps, you call \ref setPixmap with the desired QPixmap. Alternatively you can use the
  constructor that takes a QPixmap. The scatter shape will automatically be set to \ref ssPixmap.
  Note that \ref setSize does not influence the appearance of the pixmap.

/* start documentation of inline functions */

/*! \fn bool QCPScatterStyle::isNone() const
  
  Returns whether the scatter shape is \ref ssNone.
  
  \see setShape
*/

/*! \fn bool QCPScatterStyle::isPenDefined() const
  
  Returns whether a pen has been defined for this scatter style.
  
  The pen is undefined if a constructor is called that does not carry \a pen as parameter. Those are
  \ref QCPScatterStyle() and \ref QCPScatterStyle(ScatterShape shape, double size). If the pen is
  left undefined, the scatter color will be inherited from the plottable that uses this scatter
  style.

  this, be more explicit with the parameter types. For example, use <tt>QBrush(Qt::blue)</tt>

/*! \class QCPLayer
  \brief A layer that may contain objects, to control the rendering order
  
  The Layering system of QCustomPlot is the mechanism to control the rendering order of the
  elements inside the plot.
  
  It is based on the two classes QCPLayer and QCPLayerable. QCustomPlot holds an ordered list of
  one or more instances of QCPLayer (see QCustomPlot::addLayer, QCustomPlot::layer,
  QCustomPlot::moveLayer, etc.). When replotting, QCustomPlot goes through the list of layers
  bottom to top and successively draws the layerables of the layers.
  
  A QCPLayer contains an ordered list of QCPLayerable instances. QCPLayerable is an abstract base
  class from which almost all visible objects derive, like axes, grids, graphs, items, etc.
  
  Initially, QCustomPlot has five layers: "background", "grid", "main", "axes" and "legend" (in
  that order). The top two layers "axes" and "legend" contain the default axes and legend, so they
  will be drawn on top. In the middle, there is the "main" layer. It is initially empty and set as
  the current layer (see QCustomPlot::setCurrentLayer). This means, all new plottables, items etc.
  are created on this layer by default. Then comes the "grid" layer which contains the QCPGrid
  instances (which belong tightly to QCPAxis, see \ref QCPAxis::grid). The Axis rect background
  shall be drawn behind everything else, thus the default QCPAxisRect instance is placed on the
  "background" layer. Of course, the layer affiliation of the individual objects can be changed as
  required (\ref QCPLayerable::setLayer).
  
  Controlling the ordering of objects is easy: Create a new layer in the position you want it to
  be, e.g. above "main", with QCustomPlot::addLayer. Then set the current layer with
  QCustomPlot::setCurrentLayer to that new layer and finally create the objects normally. They will
  be placed on the new layer automatically, due to the current layer setting. Alternatively you
  could have also ignored the current layer setting and just moved the objects with
  QCPLayerable::setLayer to the desired layer after creating them.
  
  It is also possible to move whole layers. For example, If you want the grid to be shown in front
  of all plottables/items on the "main" layer, just move it above "main" with
  QCustomPlot::moveLayer.
  
  The rendering order within one layer is simply by order of creation or insertion. The item
  created last (or added last to the layer), is drawn on top of all other objects on that layer.
  
  When a layer is deleted, the objects on it are not deleted with it, but fall on the layer below
  the deleted layer, see QCustomPlot::removeLayer.

  This function applies the default antialiasing setting to the specified \a painter, using the
  function \ref applyAntialiasingHint. It is the antialiasing state the painter is put in, when
  \ref draw is called on the layerable. If the layerable has multiple entities whose antialiasing
  setting may be specified individually, this function should set the antialiasing state of the
  most prominent entity. In this case however, the \ref draw function usually calls the specialized
  versions of this function before drawing each entity, effectively overriding the setting of the
  default antialiasing hint.
  
  <b>First example:</b> QCPGraph has multiple entities that have an antialiasing setting: The graph
  line, fills, scatters and error bars. Those can be configured via QCPGraph::setAntialiased,
  QCPGraph::setAntialiasedFill, QCPGraph::setAntialiasedScatters etc. Consequently, there isn't
  only the QCPGraph::applyDefaultAntialiasingHint function (which corresponds to the graph line's
  antialiasing), but specialized ones like QCPGraph::applyFillAntialiasingHint and
  QCPGraph::applyScattersAntialiasingHint. So before drawing one of those entities, QCPGraph::draw
  calls the respective specialized applyAntialiasingHint function.
  
  <b>Second example:</b> QCPItemLine consists only of a line so there is only one antialiasing
  setting which can be controlled with QCPItemLine::setAntialiased. (This function is inherited by
  all layerables. The specialized functions, as seen on QCPGraph, must be added explicitly to the
  respective layerable subclass.) Consequently it only has the normal
  QCPItemLine::applyDefaultAntialiasingHint. The \ref QCPItemLine::draw function doesn't need to
  care about setting any antialiasing states, because the default antialiasing hint is already set
  on the painter when the \ref draw function is called, and that's the state it wants to draw the
  line with.

  This function is used to decide whether a click hits a layerable object or not.

  \a pos is a point in pixel coordinates on the QCustomPlot surface. This function returns the
  shortest pixel distance of this point to the object. If the object is either invisible or the
  distance couldn't be determined, -1.0 is returned. Further, if \a onlySelectable is true and the
  object is not selectable, -1.0 is returned, too.

  If the item is represented not by single lines but by an area like QCPItemRect or QCPItemText, a
  click inside the area returns a constant value greater zero (typically the selectionTolerance of
  the parent QCustomPlot multiplied by 0.99). If the click lies outside the area, this function
  returns -1.0.
  
  Providing a constant value for area objects allows selecting line objects even when they are
  obscured by such area objects, by clicking close to the lines (i.e. closer than
  0.99*selectionTolerance).
  
  The actual setting of the selection state is not done by this function. This is handled by the
  parent QCustomPlot when the mouseReleaseEvent occurs, and the finally selected object is notified
  via the selectEvent/deselectEvent methods.
  
  \a details is an optional output parameter. Every layerable subclass may place any information
  in \a details. This information will be passed to \ref selectEvent when the parent QCustomPlot
  decides on the basis of this selectTest call, that the object was successfully selected. The
  subsequent call to \ref selectEvent will carry the \a details. This is useful for multi-part
  objects (like QCPAxis). This way, a possibly complex calculation to decide which part was clicked
  is only done once in \ref selectTest. The result (i.e. the actually clicked part) can then be
  placed in \a details. So in the subsequent \ref selectEvent, the decision which part was
  selected doesn't have to be done a second time for a single selection operation.

/*! \page thelayoutsystem The Layout System
 
  The layout system is responsible for positioning and scaling layout elements such as axis rects,
  legends and plot titles in a QCustomPlot.

  \section layoutsystem-classesandmechanisms Classes and mechanisms
  
  The layout system is based on the abstract base class \ref QCPLayoutElement. All objects that
  take part in the layout system derive from this class, either directly or indirectly.
  
  Since QCPLayoutElement itself derives from \ref QCPLayerable, a layout element may draw its own
  content. However, it is perfectly possible for a layout element to only serve as a structuring
  and/or positioning element, not drawing anything on its own.
  
  \subsection layoutsystem-rects Rects of a layout element
  
  A layout element is a rectangular object described by two rects: the inner rect (\ref
  QCPLayoutElement::rect) and the outer rect (\ref QCPLayoutElement::setOuterRect). The inner rect
  is calculated automatically by applying the margin (\ref QCPLayoutElement::setMargins) inward
  from the outer rect. The inner rect is meant for main content while the margin area may either be
  left blank or serve for displaying peripheral graphics. For example, \ref QCPAxisRect positions
  the four main axes at the sides of the inner rect, so graphs end up inside it and the axis labels
  and tick labels are in the margin area.
  
  \subsection layoutsystem-margins Margins
  
  Each layout element may provide a mechanism to automatically determine its margins. Internally,
  this is realized with the \ref QCPLayoutElement::calculateAutoMargin function which takes a \ref
  QCP::MarginSide and returns an integer value which represents the ideal margin for the specified
  side. The automatic margin will be used on the sides specified in \ref
  QCPLayoutElement::setAutoMargins. By default, it is set to \ref QCP::msAll meaning automatic
  margin calculation is enabled for all four sides. In this case, a minimum margin may be set with
  \ref QCPLayoutElement::setMinimumMargins, to prevent the automatic margin mechanism from setting
  margins smaller than desired for a specific situation. If automatic margin calculation is unset
  for a specific side, the margin of that side can be controlled directy via \ref
  QCPLayoutElement::setMargins.
  
  If multiple layout ements are arranged next to or beneath each other, it may be desirable to
  align their inner rects on certain sides. Since they all might have different automatic margins,
  this usually isn't the case. The class \ref QCPMarginGroup and \ref
  QCPLayoutElement::setMarginGroup fix this by allowing to synchronize multiple margins. See the
  documentation there for details.
  
  \subsection layoutsystem-layout Layouts
  
  As mentioned, a QCPLayoutElement may have an arbitrary number of child layout elements and in
  princple can have the only purpose to manage/arrange those child elements. This is what the
  subclass \ref QCPLayout specializes on. It is a QCPLayoutElement itself but has no visual
  representation. It defines an interface to add, remove and manage child layout elements.
  QCPLayout isn't a usable layout though, it's an abstract base class that concrete layouts derive
  from, like \ref QCPLayoutGrid which arranges its child elements in a grid and \ref QCPLayoutInset
  which allows placing child elements freely inside its rect.
  
  Since a QCPLayout is a layout element itself, it may be placed inside other layouts. This way,
  complex hierarchies may be created, offering very flexible arrangements.

  (0, 1).
  </div>
  </div>
  
  \subsection layoutsystem-plotlayout The top level plot layout
  
  Every QCustomPlot has one top level layout of type \ref QCPLayoutGrid. It is accessible via \ref
  QCustomPlot::plotLayout and contains (directly or indirectly via other sub-layouts) all layout
  elements in the QCustomPlot. By default, this top level grid layout contains a single cell which
  holds the main axis rect.
 
  \subsection layoutsystem-examples Examples
  
  <b>Adding a plot title</b> is a typical and simple case to demonstrate basic workings of the layout system.
  \code
  // first we create and prepare a plot title layout element:
  QCPPlotTitle *title = new QCPPlotTitle(customPlot);
  title->setText("Plot Title Example");
  title->setFont(QFont("sans", 12, QFont::Bold));
  // then we add it to the main plot layout:
  customPlot->plotLayout()->insertRow(0); // insert an empty row above the axis rect
  customPlot->plotLayout()->addElement(0, 0, title); // insert the title in the empty cell we just created
  \endcode
  \image html layoutsystem-addingplottitle.png

  <b>Arranging multiple axis rects</b> actually is the central purpose of the layout system.
  \code
  customPlot->plotLayout()->clear(); // let's start from scratch and remove the default axis rect
  // add the first axis rect in second row (row index 1):
  customPlot->plotLayout()->addElement(1, 0, new QCPAxisRect(customPlot));
  // create a sub layout that we'll place in first row:
  QCPLayoutGrid *subLayout = new QCPLayoutGrid;
  customPlot->plotLayout()->addElement(0, 0, subLayout);
  // add two axis rects in the sub layout next to eachother:
  subLayout->addElement(0, 0, new QCPAxisRect(customPlot));
  subLayout->addElement(0, 1, new QCPAxisRect(customPlot));
  subLayout->setColumnStretchFactor(0, 3); // left axis rect shall have 60% of width
  subLayout->setColumnStretchFactor(1, 2); // right one only 40% (3:2 = 60:40)
  \endcode

//////////////////// QCPMarginGroup
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/*! \class QCPMarginGroup
  \brief A margin group allows synchronization of margin sides if working with multiple layout elements.
  
  QCPMarginGroup allows you to tie a margin side of two or more layout elements together, such that
  they will all have the same size, based on the largest required margin in the group.
  
  \n
  \image html QCPMarginGroup.png "Demonstration of QCPMarginGroup"
  \n
  
  In certain situations it is desirable that margins at specific sides are synchronized across
  layout elements. For example, if one QCPAxisRect is below another one in a grid layout, it will
  provide a cleaner look to the user if the left and right margins of the two axis rects are of the
  same size. The left axis of the top axis rect will then be at the same horizontal position as the
  left axis of the lower axis rect, making them appear aligned. The same applies for the right
  axes. This is what QCPMarginGroup makes possible.
  
  To add/remove a specific side of a layout element to/from a margin group, use the \ref
  QCPLayoutElement::setMarginGroup method. To completely break apart the margin group, either call
  \ref clear, or just delete the margin group.
  
  \section QCPMarginGroup-example Example
  
  First create a margin group:
  \code 
  QCPMarginGroup *group = new QCPMarginGroup(customPlot);
  \endcode
  Then set this group on the layout element sides:
  \code
  customPlot->axisRect(0)->setMarginGroup(QCP::msLeft|QCP::msRight, group);
  customPlot->axisRect(1)->setMarginGroup(QCP::msLeft|QCP::msRight, group);
  \endcode
  Here, we've used the first two axis rects of the plot and synchronized their left margins with
  each other and their right margins with each other.
